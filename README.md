Advantages
------------
1. Open Source and Light Weight.
2. Best Performance.
3. Helps to generate independent Queries.
4. Provides facilities to create a table.
5. Provides Query Statistics and database status.

Supported Functionalities/Better Over JDBC:
-------------------------------------------
1. Hibernate eliminates a lot of boiler plate code.
2. Support inheritance, association and collections.
3. Uses HQL which is Object Oriented and close to Java.
4. Implicitly provides transaction Management.
5. Hibernate wrapes JDBC exceptions and only throws the ones which are unchecked.Reducing the usage of try catch blocks as compared to JDBC.So, exception handling is not mandatory.
6. Supports auto DDL opertations, auto primary key generation support.
7. Supports cache memory.

Hibernate Overcomes:
--------------------
1. Database dependecy faced in the JDBC.
2. Changing of DB cost a lot in JDBC.
3. Code Portability is eaisily handled.
4. It overcomes exception handling.

Techs supported by Hibernate:
-----------------------------
1. Java J2EE.
2. Maven.
3. Eclipse Plugins.
4. X-Doclets.
